#Fire Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks

##Project Description

The "Fire Detection" project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect fire in images. The aim is to classify images as "fire" or "no fire" to improve safety in various environments. This project involves training a CNN, exploring data, and evaluating model performance to create a reliable fire detection system.

##Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a robust model that can detect fire in images, providing accurate predictions to help in safety and emergency response.

##Dataset

The dataset consists of images labeled as "fire" or "no fire." Each image represents a scene where fire may or may not be present. This data is used to train and evaluate the fire detection model.

##Methodology

Data Preparation: Normalize images and apply data augmentation to create a robust dataset. Techniques include rotation, flipping, and scaling.
Model Design: Construct a CNN with multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction and fully connected layers for classification.
Model Training: Train the model on a training dataset using early stopping to prevent overfitting.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model on a validation set to measure accuracy and loss. Use additional metrics like precision and recall to ensure accuracy.
Model Deployment: Prepare the model for real-world use, potentially creating a simple user interface for predictions.
Expected Outcome
Develop a reliable fire detection model with high accuracy.
Ensure the model generalizes well to new data without overfitting.
Provide a foundation for implementing the model in safety systems and emergency response applications.
