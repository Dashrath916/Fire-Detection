Fire Detection Project
Overview
This project uses deep learning to detect fire in images. The goal is to create a model that can tell if there's fire in a given image. It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for this task.

What This Project Does
Model Design: The model has multiple layers that help it learn about fire and non-fire images.
Training: The model is trained on a set of images with labels that tell whether there's fire.
Evaluation: We check how well the model performs using a validation set.
How to Set Up
Dependencies: Make sure you have Python installed, along with the following packages: TensorFlow, Numpy, OpenCV, and Matplotlib.
Installation: Use pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python matplotlib to install the needed packages.
Data: You need a dataset with images labeled as "fire" or "no fire." Update the code with the correct dataset path.
Running the Project
Train the Model: Run python train_model.py to train the model. It uses early stopping to prevent overfitting.
Evaluate the Model: Use python evaluate_model.py to check the model's performance. It shows validation loss and accuracy.
Make Predictions: To test the model, run python predict.py. This script predicts whether a random image contains fire.
Results
Validation Loss and Accuracy: These metrics show how well the model is performing.
Precision and Recall: These help measure how accurate the model is at finding fire without too many false positives or negatives.
